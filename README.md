### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently in parental leave.

I co-founded [Atoptima](https://atoptima.com/), a company that produces powerful optimization software for complex operations planning, and worked there as tech lead from Sep 2020 to Nov 2023.
I led Atoptima's open-source platform and I was the lead developer of [Coluna.jl](https://github.com/atoptima/Coluna.jl), a branch-cut-and-price framework in Julia.

I have a PhD in operations research from UniversitÃ© de Bordeaux. I mainly worked on two-echelon vehicle routing problems.
I was supervised by [Ruslan Sadykov](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ruslan-Sadykov) and RÃ©my Dupas.
I defended my [thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03097659) in November 2020.
